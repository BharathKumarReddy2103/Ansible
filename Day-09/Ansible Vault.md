**Ansible Vault: Securely Managing Sensitive Data in Ansible Playbooks**

**Introduction**

In today's DevOps landscape, **security** is a critical aspect of infrastructure and application management. Whether you're using **Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, or cloud platforms like AWS and Azure**, protecting sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and credentials is **non-negotiable**.

This guide explores **Ansible Vault**, a built-in tool that enables you to **encrypt and securely manage** sensitive data within your Ansible playbooks and roles. By the end of this guide, you will learn:

•	What **Ansible Vault** is and why it is needed.

•	How to **encrypt and decrypt** sensitive files and variables.

•	Best practices for managing **secrets** in Ansible.

•	How to **integrate Vault** with your Ansible workflows.

Let’s get started.

---

**1. What is Ansible Vault?**

**Ansible Vault** is a security feature in **Ansible** that allows users to **encrypt sensitive information** within playbooks, inventory files, and roles. It ensures that confidential data like:

**•	AWS Access Keys**

**•	API Tokens**

**•	Database Credentials**

**•	Sensitive Variables**

**•	Configuration Files**

... remain **secure** and are **only accessible to authorized users.**

**Why Do You Need Ansible Vault?**

Consider a scenario where you need to **store AWS credentials** in an Ansible playbook:

```sh
aws_access_key: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
aws_secret_key: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

If this file is uploaded to **Git**, your **credentials are compromised. Ansible Vault** prevents this by **encrypting** such sensitive data.

---

**2. Getting Started with Ansible Vault**

**2.1 Checking if Ansible Vault is Installed**

Ansible Vault is **built-in** with Ansible. You can check its availability by running:

```sh
ansible-vault --help
```

---

**2.2 Encrypting Files Using Ansible Vault**

To create and encrypt a **new** file using **Ansible Vault**, use the following command:

```sh
ansible-vault create secrets.yml
```

•	You will be prompted to enter a **Vault password.**

•	A new file will open in the default text editor (e.g., **vim**).

•	Add sensitive information inside the file.

For example:

```sh
aws_access_key: "AKIAEXAMPLE12345"
aws_secret_key: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
```

•	Save and exit.

•	The file is now **encrypted** and **protected.**

To verify, try opening it using:

```sh
cat secrets.yml
```

It will display **encrypted content**, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access it.

---

**2.3 Encrypting an Existing File**

If you already have a file with sensitive data, encrypt it using:

```sh
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```

This will **encrypt the existing** file without modifying its contents.

---

**2.4 Viewing Encrypted Files Without Decrypting**

If you need to **view** the encrypted content without decrypting the file, use:

```sh
ansible-vault view secrets.yml
```

This command **temporarily decrypts** and displays the content but **does not change the file.**

---

**2.5 Editing Encrypted Files**

To edit an encrypted file securely, use:

```sh
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
```

This will:

•	Decrypt the file.

•	Open it in a text editor.

•	Encrypt it again once you save and exit.

---

**2.6 Decrypting Files**

If you need to remove encryption and restore the file to **plain text**, use:

```sh
ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml
```

This command **permanently** decrypts the file.

---

**3. Encrypting Individual Variables in Playbooks**

If you only want to encrypt **specific variables** instead of an entire file, use:

```sh
ansible-vault encrypt_string "mypassword" --name "db_password"
```

This will return an encrypted version of "mypassword":

```sh
db_password: !vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          613133353366393330613365316233646263303566353662666562366564656361
          3833363935323139380a6134323965613735656138323239333434663439356232
          383037343261656561383866313732636566623165333564393963313261383738
          6564336237666665380a3132363034663238393765666537393032376566663036
          3435
```

This can now be safely used in an **Ansible Playbook.**

---

**4. Using Ansible Vault in CI/CD Pipelines**

To use **Ansible Vault** in **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions**, store the **Vault password** in a **secure location** such as:

**•	AWS Secrets Manager**

**•	Azure Key Vault**

**•	Vault by HashiCorp**

Then, use the password **non-interactively** in your pipeline:

```sh
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --vault-password-file=vault_pass.txt
```

This ensures that **secrets remain secure** in an automated deployment pipeline.


---

**5. Best Practices for Using Ansible Vault**

✅ **Use Strong Passwords**

•	Generate a **strong** password using:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 > vault_pass.txt
```

•	**Never** use weak passwords like 12345.

✅ **Store Vault Passwords Securely**

•	**DO NOT** store vault_pass.txt in **Git.**

•	Store it in **AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Vault by HashiCorp.**

✅ **Use Different Vault Passwords for Different Environments**

**•	Development**: dev_vault_pass.txt

**•	Staging**: staging_vault_pass.txt

**•	Production**: prod_vault_pass.txt

✅ **Encrypt Playbooks Before Pushing to Git**

•	Always encrypt sensitive variables before committing to Git.

✅ **Limit Access to Vault Passwords**

•	Use **IAM roles** and **permissions** to restrict who can decrypt files.

**6. Real-World Example: Secure AWS EC2 Instance Creation**

Let's create an **Ansible Playbook** that securely provisions an AWS EC2 instance **without exposing credentials.**

**Step 1: Encrypt AWS Credentials**

```sh
ansible-vault encrypt aws_credentials.yml
```

**Step 2: Secure Playbook**

```sh
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Launch EC2 Instance
      amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
        name: "Secure-Instance"
        key_name: my_key
        instance_type: t2.micro
        security_groups: ["default"]
        image_id: ami-12345678
        aws_access_key: "{{ aws_access_key }}"
        aws_secret_key: "{{ aws_secret_key }}"
```

**Step 3: Run Playbook with Vault**

```sh
ansible-playbook launch_ec2.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

Now, your **AWS credentials remain secure** and are **never exposed** in Git repositories.
