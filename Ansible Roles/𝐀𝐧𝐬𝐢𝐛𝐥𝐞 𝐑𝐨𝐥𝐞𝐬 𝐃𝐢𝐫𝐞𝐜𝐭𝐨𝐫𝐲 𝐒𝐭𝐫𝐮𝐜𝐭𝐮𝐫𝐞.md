**What Are Roles in Ansible?**

Ansible Roles are a way to organize and reuse automation tasks efficiently. Instead of writing a single long playbook, roles allow us to break down configurations into modular components. A role consists of tasks, handlers, variables, templates, files, and metadata, all grouped in a structured format.

**Roles help in**:

Organizing playbooks for scalability.

Improving reusability across different projects.

Keeping configurations clean and modular.

**Ansible Roles Directory Structure**



When you create a role using the command ansible-galaxy init <role_name>, it generates a directory structure that looks like this:

 ```bash
<role_name>/
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml
├── files/
│   ├── file.txt
│   └── script.sh
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
├── library/
├── meta/
│   └── main.yml
├── module_utils/
├── plugins/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
│   └── config.j2
├── tests/
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml
 ```

**1. Root Directory: roles/**

This is the main directory where all Ansible roles are stored.

 ```bash
roles/
│── role_1/
│── role_2/
│── role_3/
 ```

Each subdirectory (role_1, role_2, etc.) represents a separate role.

**2. Role Directory: role_1/**

Each role has its own directory that contains specific subdirectories.

**tasks/**

Defines the tasks to be executed for the role.

Contains main.yml, which is the entry point for the role.

```bash
tasks/
│── main.yml
 ```
**Purpose:** Lists the tasks in YAML format.

**handlers/**

Contains handlers, which are special tasks triggered by notify actions.

Handlers usually restart services or perform necessary system actions.

 ```bash
handlers/
│── main.yml
 ```

**Example:** If a configuration file changes, a handler can restart a service.

**templates/**

Holds Jinja2 templates (.j2 files) for dynamic configuration files.

 ```bash
templates/
│── config.j2
 ```

**Purpose:** Allows placeholders in configuration files to be replaced with variables at runtime.

**Example:**

 ```bash
server_name = {{ ansible_hostname }}
 ```

**files/**

Stores static files that need to be copied to a remote machine.

 ```bash
files/
│── file.txt
│── script.sh
 ```

**Example:**

file.txt → Can be copied to a remote server.

script.sh → Can be executed on the remote host.

**vars/**

Defines variables specific to the role.

 ```bash
vars/
│── main.yml
 ```
**Purpose:** Stores role-scoped variables.

Example main.yml:

 ```bash
---
app_name: "MyApp"
app_version: "1.0.0"
 ```

**defaults/**

Defines default variables for the role.

 ```bash
defaults/
│── main.yml
 ```

**Purpose:** Provides overrideable default values.

Example:

 ```bash
---
log_level: "INFO"
 ```bash

**meta/**

Stores metadata about the role.

 ```bash
meta/
│── main.yml
 ```

**Purpose:**

Defines role dependencies.

Specifies role author and license information.

**Example:**

 ```bash
---
dependencies:
  - role: common
  - role: database
 ```

**library/**

Contains custom Ansible modules for the role.

 ```bash
library/
 ```
**Purpose:** When default Ansible modules do not fulfill a requirement, custom Python modules can be placed here.

**module_utils/**

Stores helper utilities for custom modules.

 ```bash
module_utils/
 ```

**Purpose:** Common Python functions shared among custom modules.

**plugins/**

Contains custom Ansible plugins.

 ```bash
plugins/
 ```

**Purpose:** Extends Ansible’s functionality (e.g., filters, lookups).

**3. Other Roles** (role_2/, role_3/)

Each role follows the same structure as role_1/.

Conclusion
Ansible Roles help in modularizing automation tasks. The standard structure makes it easy to organize, reuse, and maintain infrastructure automation.
