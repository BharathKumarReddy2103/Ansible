**Ansible Essentials: Passwordless Authentication, Inventory, and Ad-hoc Commands**

**Introduction**

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies IT operations by enabling infrastructure as code (IaC). Before executing Ansible commands and playbooks, it is crucial to set up **passwordless authentication** and understand **inventory management**. Additionally, **Ansible ad-hoc commands** allow for quick automation without writing full playbooks.

This guide covers:

‚Ä¢	What passwordless authentication is and why it is required for Ansible

‚Ä¢	Different methods to set up passwordless authentication

‚Ä¢	Understanding Ansible inventory and its role in automation

‚Ä¢	How to use Ansible ad-hoc commands for quick operations

By the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of these fundamental Ansible concepts, making your automation workflows more efficient.

**1. Passwordless Authentication in Ansible**

**Why is Passwordless Authentication Required?**

Ansible follows an agentless architecture, where a **control node** (where Ansible is installed) connects to multiple **managed nodes** (servers to be managed). To execute tasks on managed nodes, Ansible must authenticate itself. This authentication can be done in two ways:

1.	Using a password for SSH authentication

2.	Using SSH key-based authentication

If password-based authentication is used, Ansible will prompt for a password each time a command is executed, which hinders automation. **Passwordless authentication** eliminates this need by ensuring seamless connectivity between the control node and managed nodes.

**Setting Up Passwordless Authentication**

There are two ways to set up passwordless authentication:

**Method 1: SSH Key-Based Authentication (Recommended for AWS and Cloud Servers)**

**1.	Generate an SSH Key Pair (if not already created):**

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Press **Enter** to save it in the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).

**2.	Copy the Public Key to the Managed Node:**

```sh
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ubuntu@<managed-node-ip>
```

Replace <managed-node-ip> with the actual IP of your managed node.

**3.	Verify SSH Access Without a Password:**

```sh
ssh ubuntu@<managed-node-ip>
```

You should log in without being prompted for a password.

---

**Method 2: Password-Based Authentication (For On-Premise or Non-Cloud Servers)**

**1.	Enable Password Authentication on the Managed Node:**

Edit the SSH configuration file:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line:

```sh
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Change it to:

```sh
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Save and exit the file.

**2.	Restart the SSH Service:**

```sh
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

**3.	Set a Password for the User:**

```sh
sudo passwd ubuntu
```

Enter and confirm the new password.

**4.	Use SSH Copy-ID to Set Up Passwordless Authentication:**

```sh
ssh-copy-id ubuntu@<managed-node-ip>
```

Enter the password when prompted.

Now, Ansible can connect to the managed node without requiring a password.

**2. Ansible Inventory: Defining Managed Nodes**

**What is an Ansible Inventory?**

An **Ansible inventory** is a file that lists the managed nodes Ansible controls. This file helps Ansible understand which nodes to connect to and execute commands on.

By default, the inventory file is located at:

```sh
/etc/ansible/hosts
```

However, you can create custom inventory files and specify their location when running Ansible commands.

---

**Basic Inventory File Format (inventory.ini)**

```sh
[app_servers]
ubuntu@192.168.1.10
ubuntu@192.168.1.11

[db_servers]
ubuntu@192.168.1.20
ubuntu@192.168.1.21
```

Here:

‚Ä¢	[app_servers] defines a group of application servers.

‚Ä¢	[db_servers] defines a group of database servers.

---

**Using the Inventory in Ansible Commands**

**‚Ä¢	Run a command on all managed nodes:**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping
```

**‚Ä¢	Run a command on specific groups:**

```sh
ansible app_servers -i inventory.ini -m ping
ansible db_servers -i inventory.ini -m ping
```

Grouping servers in inventory files helps manage large infrastructures efficiently.

**3. Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands**

**What Are Ad-Hoc Commands?**

Ad-hoc commands are quick **one-liner** Ansible commands that allow you to perform simple tasks without creating a playbook. They are useful for:

‚Ä¢	Running quick configuration changes

‚Ä¢	Testing connectivity

‚Ä¢	Managing users, services, and packages

---

**Basic Syntax of Ad-Hoc Commands**

```sh
ansible <host-pattern> -i <inventory-file> -m <module-name> -a "<module-arguments>"
```

‚Ä¢	<host-pattern>: The target hosts (e.g., all, app_servers, db_servers)

‚Ä¢	<inventory-file>: The path to the inventory file

‚Ä¢	<module-name>: The Ansible module to execute (e.g., ping, shell, command)

‚Ä¢	<module-arguments>: Arguments for the module

---

**Common Ad-Hoc Commands**

**1. Check Connectivity to Managed Nodes (Ping Module)**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping
```

Expected output:

```sh
192.168.1.10 | SUCCESS => { "ping": "pong" }
192.168.1.11 | SUCCESS => { "ping": "pong" }
```

---

**2. Execute Shell Commands on Remote Hosts**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "uptime"
```

---

**3. Install a Package on Remote Hosts**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m apt -a "name=nginx state=latest" --become
```

For **RedHat-based systems**, use:

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" --become
```

---

**4. Restart a Service**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted" --become
```

---

**5. Create a File on Managed Nodes**

```sh
ansible all -i inventory.ini -m file -a "path=/tmp/demo.txt state=touch"
```

---
