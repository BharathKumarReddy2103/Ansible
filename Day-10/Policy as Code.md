**Policy as Code: Automating Security and Compliance in DevSecOps**

**Introduction**

As organizations scale their cloud infrastructure, ensuring security and compliance across all resources becomes a challenge. **Policy as Code (PaC)** is an essential DevSecOps practice that enables **automated enforcement of security policies** across cloud environments using code.

In this guide, we will cover:

**â€¢	What is Policy as Code?**

**â€¢	Why is Policy as Code Important?**

**â€¢	How to Implement Policy as Code on AWS using Ansible?**

**â€¢	Hands-on Demonstration: Enforcing S3 Bucket Versioning with Ansible**

By the end of this article, you will understand how to **write and enforce security policies using code**, ensuring consistency across your cloud infrastructure.

**What is Policy as Code?**

**Policy as Code (PaC)** is the practice of defining and enforcing security policies programmatically. Instead of manually applying security rules, organizations use **declarative configuration files or scripts** to enforce security policies at scale.

**Example of a Policy in the Real World**

Consider a corporate office where employees must wear an **identity card** to enter the premises. This is a **policy** ensuring security.

Similarly, in **cloud computing**, policies define security and compliance rules such as:

**â€¢	All S3 buckets must have versioning enabled.**

**â€¢	No S3 bucket should be public.**

**â€¢	All EC2 instances must have an IAM instance profile attached.**

Policies ensure that cloud resources comply with **security best practices** and **organizational governance.**

---

**Why is Policy as Code Important?**

**1. Security and Compliance**

Without **automated policies**, developers might misconfigure cloud resources, leading to security vulnerabilities. For example:

â€¢	A developer **creates a public S3 bucket** that contains **sensitive company data.**

â€¢	An EC2 instance **does not have a mandatory IAM role**, leading to **privilege escalation risks.**

By enforcing **Policy as Code**, we eliminate such risks **proactively.**

**2. Scalability**

Manually updating policies across **hundreds of S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and IAM users** is impractical. **Policy as Code automates this process**, applying security rules to **all resources consistently.**

**3. Audit and Governance**

Organizations can track **who applied which policy**, ensuring **auditability** and **governance compliance**.

**How to Implement Policy as Code with Ansible (AWS Example)**

We will implement **Policy as Code** using **Ansible** to enforce **S3 bucket versioning** across all buckets in an AWS account.

**Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

**1.	An AWS Account** with S3 buckets.

**2.	AWS CLI** installed and configured (aws configure).

**3.	Python and Boto3** installed (pip install boto3).

**4.	Ansible AWS Collection** installed:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
```

**Step-by-Step Guide: Enforcing S3 Bucket Versioning**

**Step 1: List All S3 Buckets**

First, we use Ansible to **retrieve all S3 bucket names** in our AWS account.

```sh
---
- name: Enforce S3 Bucket Versioning
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    - name: List all S3 buckets
      amazon.aws.s3_bucket_info:
      register: result

    - name: Debug S3 Bucket List
      debug:
        msg: "{{ result.buckets }}"
```

This **retrieves all S3 bucket names** and stores them in the result.buckets variable.

---

**Step 2: Enable Versioning for All S3 Buckets**

Next, we loop over all the buckets and **enable versioning.**

```sh
    - name: Enable versioning on all S3 buckets
      amazon.aws.s3_bucket:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        versioning: yes
        state: present
      loop: "{{ result.buckets }}"
```

**Explanation:**

â€¢	This loop iterates over each **S3 bucket** and enables **versioning.**

â€¢	The name field dynamically picks each bucket name from result.buckets.

---

**Running the Ansible Playbook**

Save the playbook as s3_versioning.yml and execute it:

```sh
ansible-playbook s3_versioning.yml
```

Upon execution, Ansible will:

âœ… Retrieve all S3 buckets

âœ… Enable **versioning** for each bucket

âœ… Ensure compliance with **security policies**

---

**Verifying the Policy Enforcement**

After execution, navigate to **AWS S3 Console** â†’ Select a bucket â†’ Click on **Properties** â†’ Check if **Versioning** is enabled.

Alternatively, verify using AWS CLI:

```sh
aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name>
```

Expected Output:

```sh
{
    "Status": "Enabled"
}
```

**Extending Policy as Code: Additional Use Cases**

You can extend **Policy as Code** for various AWS services:

**1. Enforce IAM Policies for Users**

Automatically attach IAM policies to all users:

```sh
    - name: Attach IAM Policy to Users
      amazon.aws.iam_policy:
        iam_type: user
        name: "{{ item }}"
        policy_arn: "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess"
      loop: "{{ iam_users }}"
```

**2. Enforce Instance Profile for EC2**

Ensure every EC2 instance has an **IAM instance profile** attached:

```sh
    - name: Attach IAM role to all EC2 instances
      amazon.aws.ec2_instance:
        instance_ids: "{{ ec2_instances }}"
        iam_instance_profile:
          name: "EC2DefaultRole"
```

---

**Best Practices for Policy as Code**

**1.	Use version control (GitHub, GitLab) to track policy changes.**

**2.	Test policies in a non-production environment before applying globally.**

**3.	Automate enforcement using CI/CD pipelines with Ansible, Terraform, or Open Policy Agent (OPA).**

**4.	Regularly audit policies to ensure compliance with security frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST).**
